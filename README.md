# \# MSBA Skill Sprint – Product Monitor (Walmart-focused)

# 

# This repository is a learning sprint based on the original project here: https://github.com/andrewni1/product-monitor.  

# I chose this topic because product monitoring and alerting (availability/price changes) is a practical analytics automation workflow that connects data collection to business action.
